Sure! Let's master the **Distance Calculation** concept in **Logical Reasoning**, step by step — with simple examples, tricks, and question types.

---

## ✅ 1. **What is Distance Calculation in Logical Reasoning?**

It’s a topic where you are given directions (left, right, north, south, etc.) and distances, and you're asked to:

* Find total distance travelled
* Find the shortest/straight-line distance
* Identify final direction or position

---

## ✅ 2. **Basic Concepts**

You need to remember directions and how they behave:

### Cardinal Directions:

```
         North
           ↑
West ←     +     → East
           ↓
         South
```

### Turning Rules:

* From **North**, turn:

  * Left → West
  * Right → East
* From **East**, turn:

  * Left → North
  * Right → South
* From **South**, turn:

  * Left → East
  * Right → West
* From **West**, turn:

  * Left → South
  * Right → North

---

## ✅ 3. **Important Formulas**

* **Total Distance = Sum of all steps taken**
* **Shortest Distance = Use Pythagoras Theorem**

  $$
  \text{Shortest Distance} = \sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}
  $$

## ✅ 4. **Types of Questions**

### 🔸 Type 1: Final Direction

> Ajay walks 10 m North, turns right and walks 5 m, then turns right and walks 10 m. In which direction is he now?

**Solution**:

* 10 m North
* Right → East, 5 m
* Right → South, 10 m
  👉 He is now **facing South**

---

### 🔸 Type 2: Final Position or Distance

> A boy walks 3 km North, then 4 km East. How far is he from the starting point?

**Draw a right triangle** with legs = 3 and 4

$$
\text{Shortest Distance} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \text{ km}
$$

---

### 🔸 Type 3: Return to Origin

> A person walks 6 km North, 8 km East, 6 km South. How far is he from the starting point?

* Net North = 6 km up − 6 km down = 0
* Net East = 8 km
  👉 So, final distance = 8 km **to the East** of the start

---

### 🔸 Type 4: Complex Paths

> Rahul walks 10 m North, then turns right and walks 6 m, then turns left and walks 5 m. What is the shortest distance from his starting point?

* North = 10 + 0 = 10
* East = 6
* Final North = 10 + 5 = 15

$$
\text{Shortest distance} = \sqrt{(15^2 + 6^2)} = \sqrt{225 + 36} = \sqrt{261}
\approx 16.2 \text{ m}
$$

---

## ✅ 5. **Tips & Tricks**

* Always **draw a diagram**.
* **Keep track of turns** and directions.
* Use **N-E-S-W notation**.
* Use **Pythagoras theorem** only for **shortest path**.
* Practice on **grid or paper** initially.

## ✅ 6. **Practice Questions**

Try solving these:

1. A person walks 5 km North, then turns left and walks 3 km. What is the direction he is facing now?
2. A walks 10 m towards East, turns left and walks 5 m, then again turns left and walks 10 m. How far is he from the starting point?
3. A man walks 4 km North, 3 km East, 4 km South, then 3 km West. Where is he now?

👉 I can provide solutions and more practice problems too if you'd like!
