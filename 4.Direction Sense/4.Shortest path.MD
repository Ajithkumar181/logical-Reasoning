### 🔍 **What is the "Shortest Path" Concept in Logical Reasoning?**

These problems involve calculating the minimum distance or the shortest route between two points, usually in grid-like structures or directions involving turns (N, S, E, W).

## 📚 1. **Core Concepts You Must Know**

| Concept            | Explanation                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Directions**     | N (North), S (South), E (East), W (West)     |
| **Turning**        | Left/Right based on current facing direction |
| **Distance**       | Usually in meters or km                      |
| **Shortest Path**  | Use Pythagoras theorem or coordinate shifts  |
| **Final Position** | Keep track of direction and steps            |

---

## 🧠 2. **Important Formulas**

### 🔹 Pythagoras Theorem:

If a person moves 3m East and then 4m North
📌 **Shortest Path** = √(3² + 4²) = √25 = 5 meters

---

### 🔹 Coordinate Method:

| Direction | X-Y Change |
| --------- | ---------- |
| East      | +X         |
| West      | -X         |
| North     | +Y         |
| South     | -Y         |

Then use:
📌 **Shortest Path** = √(X² + Y²)

---

## ✅ 3. **Practice Problems with Solutions**

### ✅ **Example 1: Simple 2-step path**

A person walks 4 km North and then 3 km East. What is the shortest distance from the starting point?

📌 Solution:
Use Pythagoras Theorem:
√(4² + 3²) = √(16+9) = √25 = **5 km**

---

### ✅ **Example 2: 4-direction movement**

A man walks 5 m North, then 4 m East, then 3 m South, then 4 m West. Find the shortest distance from the start.

📌 Net Movement:

* Vertical: 5N - 3S = 2N
* Horizontal: 4E - 4W = 0
  So, final point is 2 m North of start.

📌 **Answer:** **2 m**

---

### ✅ **Example 3: Turns and Direction**

Ajith walks 10 m North, turns right and walks 5 m, then turns right again and walks 10 m. How far is he from the starting point?

📌 Solution:

* North 10
* Right = East → 5 m
* Right again = South → 10 m
  Now Ajith is 5 m East of starting point.

📌 **Answer:** **5 m**

---

### ✅ **Example 4: Multiple Directions**

A man walks 3 km North, 4 km West, 3 km South. How far is he from the starting point?

📌 Vertical: 3N - 3S = 0
📌 Horizontal: 4W
📌 **Answer:** **4 km**

## 📈 6. **How to Master This Pattern**

1. **Understand Directions** (draw compass N, S, E, W)
2. **Practice with Diagrams**
3. **Solve 30+ questions** (I can provide practice sets)

Sure! Here's a **set of practice problems based on the Pythagorean Theorem** for **Shortest Path** problems in **Logical Reasoning**. These problems will help you master how to apply:

> **Pythagoras Theorem:**
> If a person moves `a` units in one direction and `b` units perpendicular to it,
> the shortest distance = √(a² + b²)

Great! Let's solve all the 15 problems using the formula:

$$
\text{Shortest Distance} = \sqrt{(X^2 + Y^2)}
$$

Where:

* **X** is the net horizontal distance = (East - West)
* **Y** is the net vertical distance = (North - South)
