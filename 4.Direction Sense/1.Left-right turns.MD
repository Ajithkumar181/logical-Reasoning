## 🎯 Goal: Master Left-Right Turns (For Aptitude & Placement)

You’ll learn:

1. 🔰 What is Left-Right Turn in logic?
2. 🧭 Easy direction trick (visual method)
3. 🧠 Simple rule table to memorize
4. 🏃‍♂️ Real-world examples + dry runs
5. 📘 Daily practice plan

## 🔰 1. What is “Left” or “Right” Turn?

Imagine YOU are facing a direction.
When the question says:

* **Turn Left** → You rotate 90° to your **left**
* **Turn Right** → You rotate 90° to your **right**

It depends on where you are **currently facing**.

---

## 🧭 2. Visual Direction Trick

Think of this **compass cross**:

```
        North
          ↑
West ←   You   → East
          ↓
        South
```

So:

* From **North**: Left = West, Right = East
* From **East**: Left = North, Right = South
* From **South**: Left = East, Right = West
* From **West**: Left = South, Right = North

## 🧠 3. Memorize This Direction Turn Table:

| Current Facing | Turn Left | Turn Right |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| North          | West      | East       |
| South          | East      | West       |
| East           | North     | South      |
| West           | South     | North      |

📌 Learn it like a song! Keep revising it.
