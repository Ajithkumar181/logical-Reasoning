Perfect, Ajith! Let's now **master the "Number-Letter Coding" pattern** — one of the most common reasoning types used in **TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and Cognizant** placement exams.

## 🔹 What is Number-Letter Coding?

It’s a pattern where:

* Each **letter is replaced with its alphabet position**
  (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26)
* Sometimes, **math operations** are applied to the positions.
* You’ll be asked to find the code for a word or reverse it.

## 🔢 Step-by-Step: Alphabet Positions to Memorize

| Letter | Position | Letter | Position |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | -------- |
| A      | 1        | N      | 14       |
| B      | 2        | O      | 15       |
| C      | 3        | P      | 16       |
| D      | 4        | Q      | 17       |
| E      | 5        | R      | 18       |
| F      | 6        | S      | 19       |
| G      | 7        | T      | 20       |
| H      | 8        | U      | 21       |
| I      | 9        | V      | 22       |
| J      | 10       | W      | 23       |
| K      | 11       | X      | 24       |
| L      | 12       | Y      | 25       |
| M      | 13       | Z      | 26       |

## ✨ Example 1: Simple Letter-to-Number Mapping

**Q.** What is the code for “ACE”?

🧠 Positions: A = 1, C = 3, E = 5
✅ **Answer: 135**

---

## ✨ Example 2: Simple Number-to-Letter Mapping

**Q.** What word is represented by: 8 5 12 12 15?

🧠 Numbers: 8 → H, 5 → E, 12 → L, 12 → L, 15 → O
✅ **Answer: HELLO**

---

## ✨ Example 3: Add a constant to each letter position

**Q.** “DOG” is coded as 8 18 14. What is the rule?

🧠
D = 4 → 4+4 = 8
O = 15 → 15+3 = 18
G = 7 → 7+7 = 14

✅ So, **each letter is increased by a different fixed number**.
(This is a **variable shift pattern** — try finding a common rule.)

---

## ✨ Example 4: Code for “BALL” using reverse alphabet positions

> (i.e., Z=1, Y=2, ..., A=26)

B → 25
A → 26
L → 15
L → 15

✅ Answer: **25 26 15 15**

---

## 🧪 Practice Now (Try These):

1. What is the alphabet position code for: `MATH`
2. What word does this code represent: `19 3 9 5 14 3 5`
3. If CAT = 3 1 20, then what is DOG?
4. Using reverse order (Z=1), what is the code for "SUN"?
5. If “GO” = 7 + 4 = 11, 15 + 2 = 17 → code is (11, 17), find the rule.

## 🧠 Summary

| Concept                   | Description                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Letter to Number          | A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26                      |
| Number to Letter          | Reverse the above                        |
| Fixed Arithmetic Shift    | Add/subtract a value to each letter code |
| Reverse Alphabet Position | Z=1, Y=2, ..., A=26                      |
