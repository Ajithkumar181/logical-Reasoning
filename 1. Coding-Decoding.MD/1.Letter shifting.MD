## 🔹 WHAT IS LETTER SHIFTING (ALPHABET CODING)?

In this type:

* Each letter is replaced by another letter by **shifting it forward or backward** in the English alphabet.
* You must **identify the number of shifts** (e.g., +1, -2, etc.)

## 🧠 BASIC ALPHABET POSITIONS (💯 Must Memorize)

| Letter | Position |
| ------ | -------- |
| A      | 1        |
| B      | 2        |
| C      | 3        |
| ...    | ...      |
| Z      | 26       |

## 🔑 COMMON SHIFTING PATTERNS

| Type      | Example      | Explanation                  |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| +1 Shift  | A → B        | Move to next letter          |
| -1 Shift  | C → B        | Move to previous letter      |
| +2 Shift  | D → F        | Skip one letter ahead        |
| -2 Shift  | F → D        | Skip one letter backward     |
| +3, -3... | Larger jumps | Same idea, just bigger steps |

## ✨ TRICK:

Use this formula:

> If original letter = L, shift = S
> New letter = (Position of L + S), then convert back to letter
> Wrap around Z → A using modulo if needed.
