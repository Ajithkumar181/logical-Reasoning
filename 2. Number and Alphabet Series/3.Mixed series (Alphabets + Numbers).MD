Great choice! The **Mixed Series (Alphabets + Numbers)** is a fun and commonly asked pattern in reasoning and aptitude tests. Let’s understand it **step by step**:

---

## 🔹 **Mixed Series (Alphabets + Numbers)**

### ✨ **What is it?**

A **mixed series** is a sequence that contains **both letters and numbers**, often following **separate but parallel patterns**.

---

### 🧠 **Key Concepts to Know First**

1. **Alphabet Positions**:

   * A = 1, B = 2, ..., Z = 26
   * Reverse positions: Z = 1, Y = 2, ..., A = 26 (if needed)

2. **Number Patterns**:

   * May follow +, −, ×, ÷, squares, or odd/even sequence.

---

## ✅ **Common Patterns You’ll See**

---

### 🔸 1. **Fixed Letter with Changing Numbers**

**Example:** A1, A2, A3, A4, ?
🔹 Pattern: Letter is constant, numbers increase by 1.
✅ **Next = A5**

---

### 🔸 2. **Changing Letters with Fixed Numbers**

**Example:** A1, B1, C1, D1, ?
🔹 Pattern: Letters move forward, number stays same.
✅ **Next = E1**

---

### 🔸 3. **Both Letter and Number Change with a Pattern**

**Example:** A1, C3, E5, G7, ?
🔹 Letters: A (1), C (3), E (5), G (7) → +2 in position
🔹 Numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7 → +2
✅ **Next = I9**

---

### 🔸 4. **Alternating Patterns**

**Example:** A2, B4, C6, D8, ?
🔹 Letters: A, B, C, D → +1
🔹 Numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8 → +2
✅ **Next = E10**

---

### 🔸 5. **Reverse Alphabet with Pattern**

**Example:** Z1, X3, V5, T7, ?
🔹 Letters: Z, X, V, T → −2 in alphabet
🔹 Numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7 → +2
✅ **Next = R9**

---

### 🔸 6. **Paired Elements (Letter + Number, Repeating/Alternating)**

**Example:** A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, ?
🔹 Repeats each letter twice with numbers 1,2
✅ **Next = C2**

---

## 🧩 **Tips to Crack These Problems**

* Always **write the position of the letter** (A=1, ..., Z=26).
* Track letter and number patterns **separately**.
* Look for **alternate changes** (some series skip or alternate).
* Use **common series types**: odd numbers, even numbers, squares, reverse letters.

## 🔍 **Practice Problem**

**Q:** A2, D4, G6, J8, ?
👉 Letter positions: A (1), D (4), G (7), J (10) → +3
👉 Numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8 → +2
✅ **Answer = M10**
