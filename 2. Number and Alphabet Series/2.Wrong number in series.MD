## 🔹 **Topic: Wrong Number in Series**

> You are given a series of numbers or letters with a logical pattern. One number or alphabet **does not fit the pattern**, and your task is to find and correct it.

---

### ✅ **Types of Series**

1. **Arithmetic Series**
2. **Geometric Series**
3. **Square/Cube Series**
4. **Mixed Pattern Series**
5. **Prime/Composite Series**
6. **Alternating Patterns**
7. **Alphabet Series**

---

## 🔸 1. **Number Series: Find the Wrong Number**

### ▶️ **Approach**:

1. Observe differences between numbers.
2. Check if it's **Arithmetic (constant difference)** or **Geometric (constant ratio)**.
3. Try square/cube patterns.
4. Look for **alternating or mixed logic**.
5. Eliminate the odd one that breaks the pattern.

---

### 📘 **Example 1** (Arithmetic Pattern):

```text
2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 18, 20
```

**Step 1:** Check the difference
→ +3, +3, +3, +3, +4, +2
**Pattern breaks at 18**
✅ **Answer:** 18 is wrong. It should be **17**

---

### 📘 **Example 2** (Geometric Series):

```text
2, 4, 8, 16, 33, 64
```

→ ×2, ×2, ×2, **×2 → should be 32**, then ×2
✅ **Answer:** 33 is wrong. It should be **32**

---

### 📘 **Example 3** (Squares):

```text
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 35, 49
```

→ 1², 2², 3², 4², 5², **35?** 6² = 36
✅ **Answer:** 35 is wrong. It should be **36**

---

### 📘 **Example 4** (Alternate pattern):

```text
5, 10, 8, 16, 11, 22, 14
```

→ Pattern:
Odd positions: +3 → 5, 8, 11, 14
Even positions: ×2 → 10, 16, 22
✅ Pattern is correct → **No wrong number**

---

## 🔸 2. **Alphabet Series: Find the Wrong Letter**

### ▶️ **Approach**:

1. Convert each alphabet to its position:
   `A = 1, B = 2, ..., Z = 26`
2. Look at difference between letters.
3. Look for patterns like skipping letters, alternating patterns, etc.

---

### 📘 **Example 5**:

```text
A, C, E, H, I, K
```

→ Positions: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11
→ Difference: +2, +2, +3, +1, +2
✅ **H is the wrong one** → Should be **G** (after +2)

## 🧠 **Tricks & Tips**

| Trick                  | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 Look at differences | Most patterns depend on differences   |
| 🔁 Try reverse         | Sometimes series makes sense backward |
| 📐 Check squares/cubes | Common in logical series              |
| 🔀 Alternate elements  | Useful in mixed or zigzag series      |
| ⛔ Eliminate options    | If MCQ, use option elimination        |

📘 **Problem 1**:
**5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35**
🔍 Difference: +5, +5, +5, +5, **+10**
✅ **Wrong number = 35**
✔ Correct number = **30**

---

📘 **Problem 2**:
**2, 5, 8, 13, 14, 17**
🔍 Difference: +3, +3, **+5**, +1, +3
