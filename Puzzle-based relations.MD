## 📚 Step-by-Step Learning Plan

---

### ✅ 1. **Revise Basic Blood Relations**

Start with understanding direct relationships:

| Term           | Meaning                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Father         | Male parent                   |
| Mother         | Female parent                 |
| Son/Daughter   | Male/Female child             |
| Brother/Sister | Sibling                       |
| Husband/Wife   | Spouse                        |
| Uncle/Aunt     | Parent’s brother/sister       |
| Cousin         | Uncle/Aunt’s child            |
| Nephew/Niece   | Brother/Sister’s son/daughter |

👉 Learn **gender clues** and **generation clues**.

---

### ✅ 2. **Learn Symbols for Quick Notes**

Use symbols to visualize:

* `♂` = male
* `♀` = female
* `→` = is parent of
* `--` = same generation (siblings/spouses)

Example:

> “A is the sister of B, who is the father of C.”

* `A♀ -- B♂ → C`

---

### ✅ 3. **Draw Family Trees (Diagrams)**

**Always draw** while reading the puzzle. Break sentences into parts.

**Steps to build family tree:**

1. Identify the **center character** (usually in the question).
2. Add **direct relations**.
3. Work **from known to unknown**.
4. Keep **genders and generations clear**.

---

### ✅ 4. **Types of Puzzle-Based Questions**

Here are common patterns:

#### 🔹 Type 1: Multiple Statements, One Question

> A is the brother of B. C is the father of A. D is the wife of C.
> **How is D related to B?**

Solution:

* A & B → siblings
* C → father of A & B
* D → wife of C → **mother of B**

✅ **Answer: Mother**

---

#### 🔹 Type 2: Mixed Generations & Indirect Clues

> P is the brother of Q. Q is the sister of R. R is the mother of S.
> **How is P related to S?**

Build Tree:

* P & Q → siblings
* Q & R → siblings → so P & R also siblings
* R → mother of S
  → P is **maternal uncle** of S

✅ **Answer: Uncle**

---

#### 🔹 Type 3: With "Pointing to" or "Refers to"

> Pointing to a photograph, A said, "He is the son of the only son of my father."
> → Use tree method:

* A's father → A (only son)
* A’s son → photo person

✅ **Answer: Son**

---

### ✅ 5. **Practice Shortcut Rules**

Some shortcut tips:

| Clue                            | Meaning                     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| "Only son of my father"         | Myself                      |
| "Sister’s husband"              | Brother-in-law              |
| "Wife of my father’s son"       | My wife                     |
| "Son of the father of my uncle" | Cousin or brother (depends) |
