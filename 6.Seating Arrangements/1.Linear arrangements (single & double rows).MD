Great! Let's **focus on mastering Linear Arrangement problems**‚Äîboth **single row** and **double row**‚Äîstep by step.

---

## ü™ë **What Are Linear Arrangements?**

People (or objects) are arranged **in a straight line**, either:

* **All facing the same direction** (typically North or South)
* Or **facing opposite directions** (e.g., some face North, some South)

In **double row arrangements**, people are seated in **two parallel lines**, often facing each other.

---

## ‚úÖ **1. Understand Key Concepts and Directions**

### üëâ Single Row:

* Everyone **facing the same direction (North)** ‚Üí Left to Right is Left to Right.
* If **facing South**, then **left/right is reversed**.

| Statement                    | Meaning (Facing North)              |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| A is to the left of B        | A is before B in the row            |
| A is to the right of B       | A is after B                        |
| A is second to the left of B | Skip one seat left of B and place A |
| A is adjacent to B           | A is either left or right of B      |

---

### üëâ Double Row:

* Two rows facing each other (e.g., A, B, C face North; X, Y, Z face South)
* Positions are **mirrored**:

  * A facing North and X facing South, the **left of A is right of X**

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è **2. Learn Notation and Diagram Drawing**

### Example: Single Row (7 people)

```
_ _ _ _ _ _ _
```

> Always place fixed clues first. For unknowns, keep alternatives or try both options.

### Example: Double Row (facing each other)

```
   A   B   C   ‚Üí facing North  
‚¨ÜÔ∏é               ‚¨ÜÔ∏é               ‚¨ÜÔ∏é  

   Y   X   Z   ‚Üê facing South  
‚Üì               ‚Üì               ‚Üì  
```

## üß† **3. Solve Step-by-Step Examples**

---

### üî∞ **Example 1: Single Row ‚Äì Easy**

**Q:** Six people A, B, C, D, E, F are sitting in a row. B is to the immediate right of C. A is at one end. E is to the left of D but not next to C.

**Approach:**

1. A is at one end ‚Üí Try A at position 1 or 6
2. B is to the right of C ‚Üí C \_ B
3. E is to the left of D ‚Üí E \_ D
4. Try both configurations logically. You‚Äôll get:

```
A C B E F D
```

---

### üîÅ **Example 2: Double Row ‚Äì Easy**

**Q:** 4 people (A, B, C, D) are sitting in one row facing North. 4 others (P, Q, R, S) in the second row facing South. A faces P. Q is to the right of P. D is to the immediate left of A. Who faces Q?

**Approach:**

* Place A and P opposite each other.
* D must be to the left of A (since facing North).
* Q is right of P (facing South ‚Üí reversed direction).
* Final layout:

```
North Row:  D   A   B   C
South Row:  Q   P   R   S
                ‚Üë     ‚Üë
            D ‚Üê A     B
```

‚úÖ Answer: **D faces Q**
