Sure, Ajith! Mastering **coded blood relations** is important for cracking reasoning sections in competitive exams and coding interviews. Let's break it down step by step and build your skills with **concept clarity + examples + strategies**.

## 🧠 What Are Coded Blood Relations?

In **Coded Blood Relations**, family relationships are described using **coded statements or symbols** (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) or **phrases**, and you need to **decode** them to determine relationships.

---

## 🎯 Goal:

To find the **actual relationship** between two people or identify the **family tree** from coded clues.

---

## 🪜 Step-by-Step Plan to Master:

### ✅ Step 1: **Understand Basic Relationships**

Start by getting 100% clear on blood relations:

* **Father’s son** → Brother
* **Mother’s sister** → Aunt
* **Husband’s brother** → Brother-in-law
* **Daughter’s son** → Grandson
* **Sister’s husband** → Brother-in-law

Practice drawing **family trees** for each.

---

### ✅ Step 2: **Symbol-Based Coding**

Example:

> A + B means A is the brother of B
> A - B means A is the wife of B
> A \* B means A is the son of B

You will be asked:
**What does `P * Q + R` mean? Who is R to P?**

🔍 Decode from **right to left**:

* `Q + R`: Q is the brother of R
* `P * Q`: P is the son of Q
  ⇒ So, P is the **nephew** of R

👉 **Tip**: Always decode from **right to left** unless instructed otherwise.

---

### ✅ Step 3: **Practice Family Tree Drawing**

For each coded statement:

* Create a **diagram**
* Identify gender if possible
* Mark relationships clearly

---

### ✅ Step 4: **Solve Direction-Based Questions**

Sometimes coded blood relation questions are mixed with direction or sitting arrangement:

> A is sitting to the left of B who is the father of C…

📌 You need to combine **position + relation** logic.
Use **notations** like:

* ♂ for Male
* ♀ for Female
* → for direction

---

### ✅ Step 5: **Practice Coded Examples**

#### Example 1:

> A + B – C × D
> Code:
> `+` → A is the mother of B
> `-` → A is the father of B
> `×` → A is the sister of B

👉 Find the relation of D to A.

**Solution:**

* `C × D`: C is sister of D
* `B – C`: B is father of C
* `A + B`: A is mother of B

⇒ A is **grandmother** of D

---

### ✅ Step 6: **Solve MCQs and Puzzles**

Use platforms like:

* **GeeksforGeeks**
* **IndiaBIX Logical Reasoning → Blood Relations**
* **RS Aggarwal Book (Reasoning section)**

---

## 🛠 Tools You Can Use:

* **Notebook**: To draw trees
* **Highlighters**: For marking gender and positions
* **Acronyms**: Like GM (Grandmother), SIL (Sister-in-law)

## 💡 Tips to Crack It:

Sure, Ajith! 💪 Here are the **Top 5 Practice Questions** on **Coded Blood Relations** that will test your understanding from **basic to advanced level**.

---

### ✅ **Question 1: (Basic)**

**Symbols:**

* `A + B` → A is the father of B
* `A - B` → A is the mother of B
* `A * B` → A is the brother of B

**Q:** What does the expression `P - Q + R` mean?
What is the relation of `P` to `R`?

📝 *Hint: Decode right to left.*

---

### ✅ **Question 2: (Intermediate)**

**Symbols:**

* `A * B` → A is the sister of B
* `A + B` → A is the son of B
* `A - B` → A is the father of B
* `A / B` → A is the mother of B

**Q:** What is the relation of `D` to `B` in the expression:
`D * C + A / B`

---

### ✅ **Question 3: (Advanced Tree)**

**Symbols:**

* `A + B` → A is the brother of B
* `A - B` → A is the daughter of B
* `A * B` → A is the wife of B
* `A / B` → A is the father of B

**Q:** How is `A` related to `D` in the expression:
`A * B + C - D`

---

### ✅ **Question 4: (Reverse Type)**

**Symbols:**

* `A % B` → A is the mother of B
* `A $ B` → A is the son of B
* `A # B` → A is the sister of B
* `A @ B` → A is the father of B

**Q:** Which expression shows that `R` is the **grandson** of `T`?

Options:
A. `R $ Q % T`
B. `R @ Q % T`
C. `T % Q $ R`
D. `T $ Q % R`

---

### ✅ **Question 5: (Logical Deduction)**

**Symbols:**

* `A + B` → A is the husband of B
* `A - B` → A is the sister of B
* `A * B` → A is the mother of B
* `A / B` → A is the father of B

**Q:** If `W + X - Y * Z`, then how is `Z` related to `W`?
