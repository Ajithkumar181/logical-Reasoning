### 🔹 **Family Tree-Based Questions** (without coded symbols or logical puzzles)

---

## ✅ MASTER GUIDE: **FAMILY TREE-BASED QUESTIONS**

These questions describe **family relations in sentences**, and your task is to draw the **family tree**, then identify relationships.

---

### 🔸 STEP 1: **Learn the Basic Family Relationships**

Before solving, you must understand the **relation vocabulary**.

| Relation                | Description                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Father/Mother           | Parent of a person            |
| Son/Daughter            | Child of a person             |
| Brother/Sister          | Same parent siblings          |
| Grandfather/Grandmother | Parent of one's father/mother |
| Uncle/Aunt              | Brother/Sister of a parent    |
| Nephew/Niece            | Son/Daughter of a sibling     |
| Cousin                  | Child of uncle/aunt           |
| In-laws                 | Spouse's relatives            |

---

### 🔸 STEP 2: **Use a Diagram to Represent the Family Tree**

#### ✅ Use symbols to make diagrams easier:

| Symbol | Meaning         |
| ------ | --------------- |
| ⬤      | Male            |
| ○      | Female          |
| ─      | Married         |
| ↓      | Parent to child |

> **Example: "A is the father of B"**

```
A⬤  
↓  
B
```

---

### 🔸 STEP 3: **Standard Approach to Solve Questions**

1. **Read one line at a time**
2. **Draw while reading**
3. **Label clearly** (e.g., write "F" for father, "S" for sister)
4. **Focus on direction**: upward for parents, downward for children
5. **Identify generations**: group by levels

---

### 🔸 STEP 4: **Solved Examples**

---

#### 🧪 **Example 1**

> A is the sister of B. B is the father of C. D is the mother of A.
> **Q: How is D related to C?**

**Step-by-step diagram:**

* A is the sister of B → same generation
* B is father of C → C is one level below
* D is mother of A → also mother of B

**Tree:**

```
     D○  
     ↓  
 ┌───┬───┐
 A○  B⬤  
        ↓  
        C
```

✅ **Answer: D is the Grandmother of C**

---

#### 🧪 **Example 2**

> P is the mother of Q. Q is the brother of R.
> R is the father of S.
> **Q: How is P related to S?**

**Diagram:**

* P → Q (mother)
* Q, R → siblings (same level)
* R → S (father)

```
     P○  
     ↓  
 ┌───┬───┐
 Q⬤  R⬤  
          ↓  
          S
```

✅ **Answer: P is the Grandmother of S**

---

#### 🧪 **Example 3**

> M is the father of N. N is the sister of O. O is the mother of P.
> **Q: How is M related to P?**

**Diagram:**

* M → N (father)
* N → O (sister of)
* O → P (mother)

```
     M⬤  
     ↓  
 ┌───┬───┐
 N○  O○  
         ↓  
         P
```

✅ **Answer: M is the Great Grandfather of P**

### 🔸 STEP 5: **Common Tricks and Tips**

| Tip                              | Description                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 Work backwards                | If the question asks about "X related to Y", find Y and trace back to X |
| 📐 Use levels                    | Same level = siblings/cousins, one up = parent/aunt/uncle               |
| 🚫 Don't assume gender           | Unless mentioned                                                        |
| ✍ Draw neat trees                | Prevents confusion in complex questions                                 |
| 👀 Watch for “only son/daughter” | Eliminates other possibilities                                          |

### 🔸 STEP 6: **Practice Set (Try Yourself)**

Great question!

### ✅ Short Answer:

**No — these 3 problems are a solid starting point**, but **not enough** to fully **master** the *Family Tree-based questions* pattern for exams like SSC, TCS, Infosys, Bank PO, etc.

---

### 📘 Why Not Enough?

These 3 questions only cover:

* 🔹 Simple 3-generation trees
* 🔹 Clear gender & relations
* 🔹 No ambiguity, direction, or distraction

But real exams often include:

| Variant                    | Example Challenge                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 **Reverse tracing**     | "How is *C* related to *A*?" instead of A to C      |
| 👤 **Unknown gender**      | "X is the child of Y" — deduce gender using context |
| 🧩 **4+ people**           | Involving grandparents, uncles, cousins             |
| 🧭 **Multi-sentence flow** | Requires careful sentence-by-sentence mapping       |
| ❗ **Trap words**           | Like "only", "not", or assuming spouse vs sibling   |

---

### ✅ Ideal Practice Plan (To Master)

| Level           | Problems | Description                                      |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 🟢 Basic        | 10–15    | Direct 1-2 line trees                            |
| 🟡 Intermediate | 15–20    | 3–4 lines, multiple generations                  |
| 🔴 Advanced     | 20–25    | Reverse queries, indirect phrasing, tricky logic |

---

### 🧠 What You Still Need Practice On:

* [ ] Reverse questions (e.g., How is C related to A?)
* [ ] Long chain puzzles (5+ people)
* [ ] Maternal/paternal ambiguity
* [ ] Gender-deduction
* [ ] Confusing options (uncle vs father-in-law, etc.)
* [ ] MCQ-type format with answer options

---

### 📦 What I Can Give You Next:

* 🔸 A custom **worksheet with 15 questions (all variants)**
* 🔸 A printable **Family Tree Cheat Sheet**
* 🔸 A **timer-based quiz** to simulate exam speed
* 🔸 Mix of MCQs and drawing-based questions
